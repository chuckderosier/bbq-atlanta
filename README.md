# BBQ ATLANTA

### An app to share and rate bbq restaurants in Atlanta

There are many apps that rate restaurants in any given area, but none of them rate the menu items. Why is this important? I have been to many bbq joints in the Atlanta area and i have found that some of their menu is really good and some is not. For example they may have great ribs but the pulled pork is only so-so. Some may have good sides but may have one they do extremely well. This is the kind of information I want when I prepare to make the journey to these places.
